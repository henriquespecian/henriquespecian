### About me
Tech Lead | Scrum Master | C# Backend Developer | Runner | Soon-to-be Married 


- ðŸŒ± Passionate about technology and teamwork, I've spent 8 years honing my skills as a C# backend developer. As a Tech Lead and Scrum Master, I am committed to nurturing a positive and productive collaboration environment.

- :running_man: When I'm not coding, you'll find me hitting the pavement, as running is my go-to stress reliever.
